Caller: I don't know. I'm upstairs. All I can hear is them like slightly talking. Do you still have him on the phone?
Caller: No, we have no idea.
Caller: He barged- he barged in our back door with two guns.
Caller: Yeah, and he has my husband looked up in a room with him and he won't let me or my husband outside, so I had to ask. 
Caller: I just heard a really loud noise. I think it was gunfire.
Caller: Yeah. 
Caller: Okay.
