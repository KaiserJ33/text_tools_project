Caller: Ma’am. There was a shootout in my house. Uh- I don’t know who’s alive in my house and I’m scared half to death.
Caller: Uh- [address]. It’s about 13.3 miles out from the bowling alley. 
Caller: [caller's name]. My parents are [mother's name] and [father's name]. I’m scared half to death and I don’t know what to do. 
Caller: Yes, ma’am. I really hope my mom is alive. 
Caller: Thank you so much. 
Caller: No. No, ma’am. 
Caller: No, ma’am. 
Caller: And I heard- I saw the lights on in the kitchen, so I’m assuming they stole food stuff. 
Caller: I can’t believe this. 
Caller: And all I want right now is my blanket and my pillow. I’m just scared.
Caller: I’m just scared and I’m cold. 
Caller: I hear more sirens.
