Uh- our 3-year-old is nowhere to be found.
 We have looked everywhere in our house and out in our yard, and our little girl, her little girl, is- she’s missing.
She is 3 years old.
Yes, ma’am.
It would have been last night.
 Everyone, everyone went to bed at the same time.
Uh- may- maybe 8 o’clock, 8:30.
Bedrooms, closets, under, in- every- everywhere.
 We went through the house 2 or 3 times and in the yard.
 It’s not like her to ju- ju- go outside at all.
 Uh- not- not by her- not in the middle of the night or even the morning by herself.
She- she- she has musc- she has muscular dystrophy.
 Uh- she- she falls and (unintelligible) a lot of shit.
 And otherwise, she- she- she's perfectly able.
She is white, blonde hair, about uh- about 3 feet tall.
She's- uh- about 30 pounds.
Blue eyes.
 She has pyjamas.
Uh- I think they- they were pink.
Her name- her name is [daughter's name].

Uh- the- the- the last person, me and my- me and my girlfriend put her- put her to bed right when we came in.
 We came in from a trip last night and everybody went to bed at like 8:30 or 8 around that time.
I can’t say for sure because we usually go to bed at- at 7:30, but we were coming home from vacation.
No.
 Uh- we- we don’t- we're a village and we don't get along- we don't have any- any neighbors that are uh- friendly.

 My girlfriend says that the pyjamas that she was sleeping in are lying on the floor in there.
She said the pyjamas that she put her in are laying (unintelligible).
Can you hear me now?
She said that the pyjamas that she put her to bed in are laying beside her bed.
They're pink- they're- they're pink footy pyjamas.
 I can’t recall exactly what she went to bed in because I didn’t dress her.
Yes, they’re on the floor in her room.
No.
Uh- her mother, [mother's name].
