Hold- take this.

His dad said that he fell- he rolled off the bed last night.
 I was at work, fed him, he was fine and took his bottle.
 When I came home from work, he was fine.
 Before I went to sleep, he was eating a bottle.
 He was fine, and then- but he didn’t wake up at all throughout the night though.
 I got up this morning and he’s not- he- 
He’s not, he’s- 
Three months.
No.
 No, he’s- he’s- 
His- his dad said that he tried to do CPR on him.
He’s beyond help.
No.
