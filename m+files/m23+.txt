Yes, uh- my girlfriend went- left last night.
 Uh- we were at the [bar name] and staying at a hotel there and she hasn't made it back to the hotel.
 She's- I don't know where she went.
  She's got to it- She was going out leaving with some other guy.
 And she hasn't made it back.
The [hotel name].
[room number].
It's [caller's name].
[caller's surname].
Yes.
 Yes, ma'am.
Uh- in- in [address].
Yes, ma'am.
 I've been pacing since five thirty this morning.
Uh- could- could- uh- she- she was pretty- she was pretty intoxicated and-
-we have some insecurities and-
Uh- [girlfriend's name].
 I just- I didn't know, maybe she got picked up for (unintelligible), maybe she walked down the road.
 She was in a- uh- with a cute dress and some high heels and I had her ID and her phone was in the room on the charger.
 We took my phone and I really didn't think anything of it because she was like- she was like 'well this guy over here has been hitting on me and telling me you ain't treating me right' uh- 'and that he'll take me home'.
 And I was like 'whatever, if that's what you really want'.
Uh- it was like white and black.
 With black high heels with- with little beady silver balls, I think, on the bottom of the heel.
 And her purse is in the car, she don't have anything with her.
 I drove it up and down the streets to look in case she was walking down the road or something.
And I- I- I haven't seen her.
 And I called- I mean I've talked to her parents, to her ex-husband and- but- she ain't- nobody's heard from her.
Yeah.
 Yeah her phone- her phone is here.
 She didn't- she- she was wearing a- she was wearing a dress- she didn't have any pockets.
Okay, thank you.
