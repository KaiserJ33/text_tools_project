Got a baby that's unresponsive.
[address] 
Not breathing.
No.
No, I don't.
 He's nine weeks old.
Yes, I'm watching him.
[to someone else] get my cell phone, on the charger?
 Dad, go to your room for a little bit.
Please hurry.
 Please hurry.
What do I do?
Yes, he's in the bed.
 Do I move him?
I don't want to move him.
No, there's nothing in there.
 And it's stiff, please come.
Oh my God.
 He's not breathing at all, he's cold.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes, I did.
 No response.
Please hurry.
Yes.
Yes.
I did.
Nothing is happening.
I am.
I am.
Nothing.
I tried to get him up from his nap.
 He just lay here in the porta crib and he's not breathing.
(unintelligible)
Yes.
Okay.
There's nothing, sir.
 There's nothing.
I am.
 Nothing, sir.
Nothing.
 I have eight kids in my house.
 Sir, nothing.
No, I've got him in the playpen- I've still got him in his bed.
No.
He is flat on his back, that's how he was sleeping.
This is a flat surface, sir, it's not like a soft mattress.
Oh god, sir, I think he's dead.
When will they be here?
Oh god.
 It's a friend's baby from my church, he had shots yesterday.
Yeah, he had a reaction- he had reactions to them yesterday.
I think just the two-month old shots at [doctor's name]'s office.
I am.
There's nothing, sir.
 And he's cold, cold.
 Oh my god.
 Oh my god.
 I hear them coming.
I hear them coming.
Alright, thank you.
 Bye.
