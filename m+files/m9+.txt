Hi.
 Yes, uh- I need some help.
Uh, [address]
Yeah.
I- I- I can't find my daughter.
Uh- 5, she just turned 5.
 [someone's name], stop it.
[restaurant name], yeah.
Uh-, uh- this afternoon, probably?
Uh-, Three, maybe four?
 Five?
We saw her at 5?
[to someone] Oh, oh okay.
 What?
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Uh-, Grayish.
About, yeah.
 I- I mean, she was there sleeping.
 I mean, you know.
Yeah.
 Yeah.
 She- she was sleeping there and I picked up my older daughter from school.
 We all saw her sleeping there.
 So, and-and, you know, we went to work and, you know, we let her sleep.
 We-and- and we got busy and then, uh- uh- after we got busy, you know, we started cleaning up and then, you know, we opened the door and she's not here.
[caller's name].
But we-we saw her, like all of us.
 Like, my wife, myself and my older daughter.
 When we came back, when I picked up my uh- uh- older daughter from school, we saw her there sleeping.
No, no, no.
 I- I have no idea.
 I mean, she was sleeping in the back.
 It's kind of hard to say when she was-
No, I didn't say that.
 I said my wife is here all the time.
Okay, okay.
 Uh- I think you- Okay.
 When we pick- I'm sorry.
 What I meant was myself, okay?
 When I went to pick up my daughter, when we came back, my- myself and my daughter, not my wife.
 My wife was here the whole time.
When we came back-
[daughter's name], [daughter's name].
In the front or the back?
Okay.
 All right.
Okay.
 Thank you.
 Thank you.
