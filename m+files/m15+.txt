I need an ambulance and the cops!
 [roommate's name]'s full of blood.
 The baseball bat is full of blood.
 The front door was open.
I didn’t see nobody and I’ll be damned if I’m looking!

 The baseball bat is full of blood, laid on the flood, and [roommate's name]'s face is covered in blood.
[roommate's name].
It’s a she!
Yeah, her whole face is covered with blood.
 She’s bleeding bad.
Let me see.
 I don’t know.
 Let me see.

 [roommate's name]!
 I don’t know.
 Her whole face is covered in blood.

Please don’t hang up!
I’m scared to go to the house.
