I do, I- 
Why?
 Uh- my partner is in the kitchen, he’s on the floor, and (unintelligible) we were having an argument and he’s stabbed himself, right?
 It’s not the first time he’s done it.
 The last time he smashed himself in the head with a hammer, and I just need him out of my property.
 I need him out-
I don’t know.
 He’s on the floor.
I've just come out of the way ‘cause he’s fighting himself with a knife.
My name is [caller's name].
I don’t know.
 I’ve come out of the way because he’s tried to stab about him and he punched me all over and he’s tried to cut himself with a knife.
 And he’s lying-
Yep.
 Right, yes he has.
 Right-
Caller:-I've come to the kitchen now.
 He’s un- not- he's unconscious.
 [partner's name; x4] Look at us.
 Look at us.
 [partner's name], look at us.
No, he’s not.
 He’s semi-conscious.
 He’s stabbed himself in the fucking chest.
 Right?
No, no.
He does this all time, man, and I’m sick of it because he does this on purpose and he blames me.
 [partner's name]?
A fucking knife.
Uh- it’s a big kitchen knife.
 I’m going to turn the music down because I’ve been sitting in the kitchen with him all night, right?
 He’s a fucking lunatic and I’m sick of this shit.
 [partner's name; x2]?
 Stop it.
Look at us.
 [partner's name], look at us.
 [partner's name; x2].
 Look at us.
 Look at us.
 No, he’s not.
 He’s sem- semi-conscious.
His name is [partner's name].
 Right.
 Have we-
-not responding.
[partner's name; x2] Please, baby.
 Please.
 Please.
 Please, baby.
 The door is open.
 Please!
 I’m in the (unintelligible) kitchen with him.
