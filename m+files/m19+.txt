[address].
[address].
Yes, ma'am.
I woke up this morning and my daughter was not in this house.
 I don't know if she walked out or I don't know what's going on but she's not here.
 I'm not-
She's five.
Yes, ma'am.
I saw her, uh- at five thirty last night.
Yes, ma'am.
 No, when she went back to bed.
Yes, ma'am.
She know how to unlock the front doors.
[daughter's name].
[daughter's name].
She's mixed.
She's bi-racial.
She's wearing just a blue big old bla- a blue shirt with designs on it.
 But her hair is out.
She didn't take no shoes, no pants, no nothing.
Yes, ma'am.
They're white and got pink- I guess- I- I can't really remember.
 They're like white with pink designs on them.
No, ma'am.
 They were locked but she knows how to unlock the front door.
Yes, ma'am.
Yes, ma'am.
I checked everywhere.
 I haven't checked the back end of the neighbourhood yet but I checked the front end.
 I'm just- I don't know what else to do- I'm so- I'm- I don't know what else to do.
There's my son but he's here.
No it was not unlocked.
 But I'm telling you, she knows how to unlock it.
 I'm hoping that she didn't unlock it and walk out.
[caller's number].
Hurry.
 Yes.
 It was like a frizzy afro.
I don't know ma'am, I don't remember.
Alright.
