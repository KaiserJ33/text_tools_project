Yes, yes, yeah.
 She’s in her pajamas.
Uh- I put her to bed at 9:30, quarter to 10.

No, no, no, not really.
 She looks out her win- window and shit but, I don’t- I don’t know.
She’s tall, she’s skinny, she’s got blonde hair, and blue eyes.
She had pink pajamas and a purple jacket, a purple pumpkin patch jacket.
Yes, yes.
Yes, ma’am.
No.
 Like, she gets up and plays, like, in the middle of the night she looks out- I’ve caught her at her window before with it open, but I don’t- I don’t think- I don’t know.
I’ve got a 2-year-old and a 3-week-old baby.
Yeah, they- they’re- they're still here.
Yes.
Have I- have I?
No, she was in, like, she was in bed about sleeping as well.
 We’ve all just gotten up.
Yes.
 And there’s my kid’s father here.
 He- he- my kids- he- he is here as well.
Yeah, he’s gone looking for her.
Yes, that’s right.

Yes, she’s not here.
 I’ve looked everywhere.
Uh-, she’s only got like a little one on her stomach.
 I’ve- I've got one in the same place as well.
Yes, but she hasn’t got the earrings in.
Alright.
I will.
Yes.
Alright, thank you.
Bye.
