Oh, hiya.
 Uh- I think we’ve been burgled and my wife’s been attacked.
We’re on [address].
Yeah, well, I’ve just come home, I was- I was just out.
 I- I went to get, like, something to eat and see the lads at work and get my laptop-
 -and I’ve just come home and the house is ransacked and she’s just on the floor.
 She’s got duct tape all over her and she’s, like, unconscious.
I’m trying- should I take this duct tape off her?
Well, no, because she’s knocked unconscious.
Please, can you send someone quick?
My name’s [caller's name].
I can’t get it off her.
 My battery’s really low as well, so if I die-
How long will it be?
Okay.
No, I ju- I- I can’t feel anything.
 Her hands are really cold.
About an hour.
[wife's name].

Yeah, it is.
Can you ring my dad, please?
Can you ring my dad?
Well- well should I wait for the- I don’t know what to do?
Yeah.
No, we don’t have any children.
We- we live on our own.
 We’re- we're the pharmacists at [street name].
My parents live in [town name].
Yeah, I’ve got the duct tape off her.
 It was- it was on her legs, right?
 By her ankles and on her arms tight like she had been tied up, but her hands are really cold!
Well, I can see marks on the neck, like, really dark neck.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
 She’s got, like, blood on her nose and, like, stuff dripping out onto the floor.
She’s in the recovery position.
 I put her in that already.
No.
 [wife's name], come on, baby.
 Wake up!
Baby, wake up.
Will you ring my dad, please?
No, there’s nobody here.
 I don't think so.
 We're in the house.
I'm here!
They're here.
 It’s [wife's name].
Okay.
Okay.
