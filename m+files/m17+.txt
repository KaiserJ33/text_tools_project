Uh- yeah, I need an ambulance at [address].
Yeah.
 Ma'am, I- uh- I don't know what this kid has done.
 She's like going into a seizure or something.
 And I- I- I don't know.
 Man, I just keep on- [child's name]?
 [child's name]?
 I'm trying to be-
Yes.
 I'm- uh-

 She was-
No.
 Ahhh.
 Come on, baby.
 Wake up, the fuck?
 Ah.
 What the fuck.
Wake up.
 Come on.
 I should stop beating on her, huh?
 Oh my- I don't know what to do, ma'am.
 I'm panicking.
 Hello?
I don't know what to do.
 Hell-
Uh- no, and this ain't even my kid.
 How am I supposed to-
Two.

 Two.
 Come on.
 Please, hurry up.
I'm not being calm.
 Believe me, ma'am.
 I've- I've started slapping on her and everything.
I'm slapping the shit out of her, trying to wake her up.
 What am I- what am I supposed to do?
 Tell me how to do CPR, quick.
 Huh?
Go ahead.
Yes.
 Yes.
Okay, yeah.
Yeah.
 And it's going right back out.
 Ma'am, (unintelligible) hole in the back of her head.
 Come on, please.
 Lord, fuck (unintelligible).
Oh my god, I can feel her heart beating.
Yeah.
Oh my god.
 What the fuck.
Ma'am, I swear I have I- I put some (unintelligible) on her, trying to wake her up.
 Man, I can't do any more to her.
 I just want you guys to get her.
 I'm slapping the shit out of her head.
 (Unintelligible).
 Ma'am, I don't even know what to do, ma'am.
She was just eating in her room.
Oh my god, ah.
Ah, where they at?
 (Unintelligible)
Yeah, the door open.
 I'm- Oh my god.
 Ma'am.

 Baby, please.
 Please.
 What happened to you?
 Oh my god.
 (Unintelligible)
She just took a deep breath in.
Oh my god.
No, no.
 Her eyes are just like she's not even here, man.
Oh my god.
 Yeah, she had one a couple of days ago but it was real short and I didn't see nothing of it.
 She hit her head.
She hit her head the other day.
Oh my god.
 Okay, I see them.
 Thank you, thank you, thank you.
