I need somebody to come.
 I need the police.
 I need an ambulance.
 My husband’s been shot.
There was a man here.
 He shot him and he told me not to call the police.
No, I was in the bedroom and- and he told me to sit down and count to 100 and not to call the police until I got to 100.
 He said if I called y’all before I reached 100 he’d come back and kill me.
 Please hurry!
 I think he’s still alive.
 He’s making noises.
 Please!
 What can I do for him?
Yes, yes!
On the ground?
 You want me to get him off the bed?
Okay, okay.
 He’s on the floor.
1-2-3-4.
 1-2-3-4.
 Should they be here?
