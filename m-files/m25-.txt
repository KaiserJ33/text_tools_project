Yes, uh- how do I go about, I guess, uh- a missing person?
Yes.
Last seen from uh- [location], left the [place].
Last night.
And walking south on [street name], uh- through a friend.
Uh- it's my girlfriend and she's- she does live with me and she's never done this before.
[girlfriend's name].
Yes.
We were at the [location] and I think it's on the corner of [street name] and [street name].
Yeah, just off of [street name].
And then she was walking south on [street name] from there.
 I was on the same road in a different car around there.
Yeah, she had a black and gray striped- horizontal striped top.
And with black pants, black like capri pants and grey high heel shoes.
Uh- no.
[caller's first name].
[caller's last name].
Yes.
No idea.
 I called some friends.
Yeah, and it's been off since last night.
It goes right to voicemail.
Yeah.
 How long will it be?
Yes.
Okay.
Well, I didn't- I didn't last see her.
 It was probably around eleven thirty, twelve, I'm guessing?
Yep.
 And I had talked to her on the phone.
 She was with a couple of my friends in a different vehicle and then I was riding down there from the west side.
Okay.
 Thank you.
