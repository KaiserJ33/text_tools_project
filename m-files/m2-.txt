I need a policeman and an ambulance at my house, right now.
No, listen to me.
 This lady is trying to get away.
 She stabbed my husband in the head.
[address].
 Hurry, please.
She tried to- she tried to get away.
 Please, send- just send somebody.
My husband has (unintelligible) her and now she's busted the door out and stabbed him.
 Please hurry up.
Yeah.
Please, just send somebody.
 Okay, he told her (unintelligible) is asleep but he's bleeding very bad.
(unintelligible).
Just hurry up.
Yes.
 And he's trying to hold her down but she said she's not going to jail so she's stabbing him and she's bit- she's biting him.
Hello.
Hurry up.
My husband is bleeding to death.
 Now, would you just send somebody.
It is- her name is [intruder's first name], okay?
He's got her, he's trying to hold her down.
 And she-
-she punched him up.
I don't know.
 It's a knife, sticking out of his head.
Yes, I just saw it sticking out of his head.
My name is [caller's first name] and I'm sorry but I am really freaked out right now.
She used to work for him.
Yes, and she stole a lot of equipment, so he pressed charges on her.
 And now all of a sudden she's in our house in the middle of the night stabbing him.
Yes.
 He's just trying to get away but he's bleeding.
I don't know.
Yes, I have four.
Yes.
Why are they not here?
 I don't know what her last name is.
(to husband) baby, I told you that.
 Why are they not here yet?
(unintelligible) killing her before they get here if they don't hurry up.
Yes, he's trying but he's losing-
I don't know how old she is.
 Please stop asking me questions.
Yes?
 Forty-one.
What?
Yes, they're upstairs asleep.
 Please tell everyone to hurry up.
Why are they not here yet?
 Why are they not here?
I'm coming, [husband's name].
 I'm going to end up killing her if she doesn't be still, okay?
 I'm going to hit her with this baseball bat if she doesn't be still.
Look, I'm going to keep her there one way or another.
 She's not getting away this time.
 This is the problem.
 They couldn't find her.
Okay.
 The police are supposed to be arresting her for the last month.
 (to husband) what?
 I know.
 [intruder's name], be still.
 I'm not going to kill you, lady, you're going to prison is what's going to happen.
There is supposed to be a warrant out for her arrest but the police aren't doing their job.
 [intruder's name], I'm not going to kill you, okay?
 No.
 Ma'am you need to get that- uh- ambulance here quick, okay?
 He's bleeding everywhere.
No, in the head.
(to husband) I've already told her that three times, [husband's name].
I've said all I can see right now.
(to intruder) Just be still.
We're in the bedroom.
I was just standing in the doorway.
 I don't remember if I left it open or not.
[intruder's name], shut up.
 Ma'am, can I please get off the phone now because I'm going to have to wind up hitting her.
Yes, I do.
 And if I have to, I will use it.
My husband is bleeding all over the place.
Okay, he's doing all he can to hold her down and if she moves, I'm going to hit her.
Okay.
 But I have-
Well what do you want me to do?
To the left.
Yes.
She's running through the door.
 (to intruder) come here, come here, come here, come here.
 Hurry, hurry, hurry.
(unintelligible).
 Hurry, please, hurry.
(unintelligible) you okay?
Yes, they're here.
Okay, but now we need an ambulance.
Okay, bye.
