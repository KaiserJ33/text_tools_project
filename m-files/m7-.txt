Ma’am.
 There was a shootout in my house.
 Uh- I don’t know who’s alive in my house and I’m scared half to death.
Uh- [address].
 It’s about 13.
3 miles out from the bowling alley.
[caller's name].
 My parents are [mother's name] and [father's name].
 I’m scared half to death and I don’t know what to do.
Yes, ma’am.
 I really hope my mom is alive.
Thank you so much.
No.
 No, ma’am.
No, ma’am.
And I heard- I saw the lights on in the kitchen, so I’m assuming they stole food stuff.
I can’t believe this.
And all I want right now is my blanket and my pillow.
 I’m just scared.
I’m just scared and I’m cold.
I hear more sirens.
I want my mom.
Yeah, I see another police car.
Okay.
