Oh, it’s the first time I’ve been home in like three weeks.
 Uh- my fiancée has been staying here-
-and I had nowhere else to go tonight.
 So I asked her, ‘Hey are you awake?
’ etc.
 and she didn’t answer.
 So I came home, and it’s so bad.
 It’s so bad.
I- I saw my rifle.
At her feet, at her feet.
 Yes, I think so.
 I think so.
 Her brain is laying on the carpet and her head is split wide open.
It’s- it's at her feet.
Yes, ma’am.
No, ma’am.
 I- I have a shotgun in the closet- if it’s still there.
 I haven’t even checked.
 But there was only my rifle that it looks like she got out of the case.
No, ma’am.
Her name is [girlfriend's name].
White.
Uh- 27, 28.
 She was born in ’91.
 Sorry, I can’t think right now.
Yes, ma’am.
About 5-7.
Thin.
Uh- I can’t remember.
 I’m sitting on the back porch.
Yeah, it was a T-shirt and looked like uh- sleep pants or something.
She does.
It’s in the garage.
It’s a white uh- 2006 Acura SUV.
 I think it’s called an MDX.
I don’t.
 I can get into the garage and tell you.
Okay, okay.
My name is [caller's name].
I am uh- half-white, half-Mexican.
I'm 34.
Uh- 6-2.
Skinny.
I’m wearing a blue shirt and kind of uh- white- not white pants, but they- they would look white.
Yes I do.
It’s a silver Dodge.
And- and officers have arrived.
Okay, thank you.
