Can you please help me?
 Someone’s trying to get in my house.
They tried my front door and my side door and now they’re trying to break in my back gate.
Alright, I have a  gun in my hand.
 I’m terrified.
Okay.
I think they’re in the back now.
Somebody’s in the back and on my porch.
Please hurry, please!
Oh, no.
No.
 Somebody is banging on my Arcadia door.
No.
There’s no vehicles out front in my driveway either.
 Now somebody is walking around on my back porch.
Oh!
 They just broke in.
Yeah.
 They broke my Arcadia door.
No, they’re coming in right now though.
I just saw one.
I seen- green hoodie.
 They’re coming in right now.
 Please, please, please.
They’re breaking out my window.
I’m in my bathroom.
Yes.
Yes.
He’s right here.
You see the way you just beat me half to death?
What’d you come in my house for?
I shot him.
Yeah.
Please hurry.
 Don’t get up or I’ll shoot your ass again!
In my house.
 He’s in my bathroom, half in my bathroom and half in the hallway.
What?
He’s laying half in my bathroom and half in the hallway.
 Where in the house- in the body?
I don’t know.
No, I don’t recognize him.
I’m in the front bathroom.
I said don’t move.
He said he thought the house was abandoned.
 An abandoned house with a car and locked doors and, yeah.
 He said he’s sorry.
 You knocked, you banged, you tried to get in doors.
 I heard you out there.
Because why should I unlock the door?
 And you’re rattling and beating on everything and trying to climb my fence.
 I’m not even gonna talk to you.
Please get somebody here.
I don’t know.
 My face is bleeding, I’m bleeding from someplace, I don’t even know where.
 I don’t know.
 He was beating on me.
He was beating on me when he found out I was in here.
 That’s why I dropped the phone and I almost dropped the gun, but I ended up shooting.
Yeah.
I’m not gonna walk over the top of this guy.
I will.
Okay.
Come right back.
 I put the gun down.
