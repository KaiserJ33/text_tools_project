There’s someone in my house.
There’s someone in my house.
There’s a man laying on my bedroom floor.
Oh, please.
 He broke my window and everything at my back door.
No, I don’t.
 Come with me.
 Come on, please.
I have my kids.
 The guy’s in my bedroom.
 All right, guys.
 All right.
 Come on, move out.
 Come on, get out of here, boys.
 Come on, get out.
 Oh my God, run.
 There’s a man in my bedroom.
 I don’t know who he is.
Windows.
 No, he's black.
My bedroom.
 On the floor.
No, I was sleeping.
 He broke through my backdoor.
Oh my God, I can't believe this.
 There is a man in my house.
I'm outside.
 I’m in my neighbor’s yard- in my neighbor's driveway.
No.
 No.
 Oh my God.
 No, I am with my kids.
I have two kids.
 My son and my daughter.
 (Unintelligible).
 Oh my God.
My husband’s at work.
Oh my God.
 Oh my God.
 I can't believe this guy’s (Unintelligible).
Hello.
Yes.
No, he came, he busted my back door.
He was running and he kept putting his finger up to his mouth on and told me, “shh shh”.
 I thought it was my husband coming home from work early.
 Oh my God, I can't believe this.
 Oh my God, and he punched my back window out.
I don't know who he is and why he’s in my house.
Just stay, just stay right here, guys, please.
 Just sit down, please.
Yeah.
He was on my bedroom floor, hiding in my- in my clean clothes basket.
 And he gets on, and I'm- I'm freaking out.
And as soon as we stopped here, I got to get off my phone because I've got to call my husband.
Oh, please hurry.
 Please hurry.
 I don't know if he’s still in the house or not.
Yeah?
Okay.
No.
Oh my God.
He punched my back window out.
Oh my God.
 Oh my God.
No.
 He is- I heard a door sound.
Oh, my God.
Leave him alone.
 Oh my God.
 Oh my God, he's coming out the front door right now.
 Oh my God, (Inaudible).
 The cops are coming.
He broke my back window.
 Oh my God.
 Oh my God.
He's trying to get into this house now.
Across the street.
 I don't know how to get out.
 Get the fuck out of here.
He’s got him.
Oh my God.
 Okay, the cops are here.
 I got to let you go.
All right.
 I have to run across the road and go check on my dog.
All right.
 Thank you so much.
 Bye.
