I’m right down on [street name].
Yeah, [location].
No.
 (unintelligible) it’s just on-
My friend is dead.
 She drowned.
It’s north of [location].
 Uh- my young friend was having lots of problems.
 I’m like a dad to her and we came back to this- by this pond.
 She decided to take her clothes off and go in the pond and I went in after her.
 I couldn’t see her and (unintelligible).
She went in the water.
 I kept telling her it was too cold, don’t go in, but she went in.
Yes, and she swam out across the lake and I kept yelling [friend's name] and I took off my clothes and I went in and I looked for her and I couldn’t find her.
She's drowned.
 She swam around the lake and I couldn’t see her anymore and I was yelling [friend's name] and I took off my clothes and I swam out there and (unintelligible).
Okay, (unintelligible).
It’s- it’s a pond.
 It’s a pond just west of [location].
 Yes, I kept telling her it’s too cold, [friend's name] don’t go.
 She’s been having a lot of problems though.
 She’s flunking out of school and she can’t-
I think so and I couldn’t help her.
No, I’m like- I’m like her dad.
My name’s [caller's name].
 Oh, God.
 Please help me.
Yes, she swam out there and I’ve been yelling [friend's name] for 5 minutes and I threw off my clothes and went in the water and kept swimming around.
 I had a quadruple bypass.
 I'm not a great swimmer, but I kept- I kept swimming around and I hope she’s playing a joke and just ran to the other side, but I don’t think so.
 She kept talking to me about suicide.
 She’s going to a recruiter today, said she wants to go into the military.
 She was flunking out of school.
 Her-
Yeah, she has been for a couple of weeks now.
 (unintelligible) for her.
I guess, she had stuff to drink, yes.
Uh- she takes pills, anti-anxiety pills.
 Here they come, I see the lights.
I see the lights, (unintelligible).
