There was a guy with a gun in the [store name] and-
The [place] one.
Because I can see it and I just heard it go off and now he’s walking towards my car.
Uh- He’s- It's a- it's a- it's a pistol and now he’s walking back in.
Yeah, I- the- the girl was screaming, like, I heard shots, but I don’t know what-
[to Speaker 2] I kind of don’t want to sit here if he’s, ya know.
 Should we go, like, hide behind the building or something?
 Yeah, I know, but, like, if he tries to shoot us for seeing him.
He’s not getting into a car.
He’s a- he's a Black man.
 He is wearing a black baseball cap.
 He’s got white shirt with, like, a black vest on and now he’s running northeast, east, southeast-
Now he’s moving-
Now the person is running back towards the- back towards the store-
I- I’m horrible with directions, okay?
Uh- he’s running towards the [different shop name].
I don’t know, (unintelligible)
Oh, my God, she is bleeding.
 She is, uh- here, okay, so north of the Campanile, southeast, southeast-ish, like, towards uh- like, towards [different store name] and towards- except the other, uh- God.
Went towards southeast-ish, that direction-ish.
Uh- it’s the only [store name] on [street name], sure.
Oh, that was me just trying to get my directions, I’m sorry.
That’s the only way I know northwest and north.
He just walked in and he started screaming and- and she- and he- I heard shots and, I don’t know.
 When I went back to look he just, like- I mean, he didn’t point the gun at me or anything like that, but I didn’t know what was going on, so I, like, you know, ran.
Yes, she was working behind the pizza counter.
 [to Speaker 2] No, shit!
What?
No, I’m back in the [store name].
 We came to see if she was okay since he just kind of ran off.
Yeah, we went back into the store.
She’s in the kitchen laying on the ground next to the- next to the kitchen-
She was shot, there’s bleeding.
There’s, like, a shell sitting on the table.
 Hey guys.
[to Speaker 3] Who are you calling?
 I called 911.
 Dude, I don’t think you’re getting any job.
Yeah, I called 911.
 I’m on the phone with them.
 They put me on hold.
Yes.
Lock the door, dammit.
There’s a dead person in the kitchen.
Yes.
Okay.

 Yeah, he just pulled up.
Yeah.
Yup.
