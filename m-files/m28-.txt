Uh- I’ve got a baby, an 8-month-old baby.
 He’s just had some fruit and we think the baby- the baby seems to be choking.
He’s cry- I mean, he’s breathing and crying, but it looks like he- he can’t swallow.
Do not slap him on the back?
 Okay.
That’s the baby you can hear.
He’s awake, yeah, and he- he’s coming out in a red rash.
 It- it’s like he’s trying to swallow, but he can’t.
He’s completely alert.
He’s breathing, but he’s sort of breathing and then he’s like- gulping as if something’s stuck.
Fruit?
 Yeah, it was stone-fruit.
I’m looking at him closely.
Okay, his eyes are quite watery, his- his face is getting red, and, like- he’s breathing and then stops, like breathing, stops, breathing.
 Uh- he’s crying- trying to cry and then it’s like something’s stuck.
Yeah, he can, yeah.
No, no.
On his cheeks it looks like he could be coming out in a rash on his cheeks and around his eyes are getting redder.
No, no allergic reaction before.
Yeah, we’re just watching him, yeah?
Yeah, how long do you think until the ambulance comes?
Yeah.
He’s not swallowing, yeah.
 He’s breathing, but he’s not swallowing.
 Like something’s stuck in his, like- neck.
I’ll check with his mum.
 Has he ever had this fruit before, yes or no?
A nectarine.
The rash is coming out more.
 It’s coming out more onto his forehead, but yeah, it’s- it’s coming out- it’s- it's coming out more.
 His eyes are quite (unintelligible).
 It’s alright.
He’s alright, sorry.
Yeah.
Yeah, we thought he was choking and-
A reaction?
If it is a reaction, his airway could be swelling.
Oh, you really don’t know what’s gonna happen, mate.
No.
 Alright, the ambulance is just getting here.
Okay.
Alright.
