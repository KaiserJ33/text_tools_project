Why?
 There's a man in my house.
[address].
House at the end of the street.
 (To intruder) why are you in my house, bro?
She's on fucking speaker phone.
 Why are you in my house, though?
It's me, my wife and our daughter.
She's two.
[to wife] Babe, shut up, go upstairs.
We didn't know- No.
 (to wife) Here, go that way, go that way.
 Stay right there and let them-
(to intruder) Let my wife upstairs.
Okay.
Alright.
He's standing next to me in my hallway.
We still are, he's right here.
They were coming into [street name].
No, I ain't going anywhere.
Bro.
Why are you locking that door?
 Don't lock that door, bro.
I get what- I get what you're saying but you have two guns, bro.
(Unintelligible) is crazy, man.
 I'm not doing anything.
This is my house, man.
Why are you even here in the first place?
I hear you, bro.
I hear you.
Okay, I get you.
I'm not.
 I'm not going to.
