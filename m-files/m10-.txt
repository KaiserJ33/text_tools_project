I don't know.
 I'm upstairs.
 All I can hear is them like slightly talking.
 Do you still have him on the phone?
No, we have no idea.
He barged- he barged in our back door with two guns.
Yeah, and he has my husband looked up in a room with him and he won't let me or my husband outside, so I had to ask.
I just heard a really loud noise.
 I think it was gunfire.
Yeah.
Okay.
